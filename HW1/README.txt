Using the resize function installed by TAs, it is not guaranteed that it creates a specific size.
The default setting of halftone is monokuma.bmp, image resizes in 64, patches resizes in 16.

As I don't know how to get the visual studio 2015 C++ compiler, it used the visual studio 2019,
and runnable in code block.

The command prompt should allow single or more parameters.
that means it could allow only the path name, or path name with size of content image,
i.e. C:\> halftone MARBLES.bmp,  C:\> halftone MARBLES.bmp 256
